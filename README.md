# 🤖 Design and Development of Obstacle Detection and Pick-and-Place Bot

An intelligent autonomous robotic system designed to **detect obstacles**, and **pick and place** them if they are within suitable dimensions. This project combines robotic arms, sensors, and navigation to automate material handling in industries and complex environments.


## 🎯 Objectives

The main objective of developing this robot is to create a **versatile and efficient solution** for automating **material handling** and **transportation** tasks in various industrial and commercial settings.

### ✅ Key Goals:
- Automate material handling processes.
- Navigate autonomously through messy or unstructured environments.
- Detect and classify objects using sensors.
- Pick and place items precisely using a robotic arm.
- Reduce manual labor and increase safety in hazardous tasks.
- 

## 🧠 Scope

This project covers:
- ⚙️ Mechanical Design
- 🤖 Robotic Arm Integration
- 💻 Embedded Systems & Arduino Programming
- 📡 Obstacle Detection using Sensors
- 🚗 Autonomous Navigation
- 🧑‍💻 Human-Machine Interface

It integrates mobility and manipulation in one unit — making it ideal for use in **industries, disaster zones, farms**, and **hazardous areas**.
