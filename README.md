#  Design and Development of Obstacle Detection and Removal Bot

An intelligent autonomous robotic system designed to **detect obstacles**, and **pick and place** them if they are within suitable dimensions. This project combines robotic arms, sensors, and navigation to automate material handling in industries and complex environments.


##  Objectives

The main objective of developing this robot is to create a **versatile and efficient solution** for automating **material handling** and **transportation** tasks in various industrial and commercial settings.

###  Key Goals:
- Automate material handling processes.
- Navigate autonomously through messy or unstructured environments.
- Detect and classify objects using sensors.
- Pick and place items precisely using a robotic arm.
- Reduce manual labor and increase safety in hazardous tasks.
  

## Scope

This project covers:
-  Mechanical Design
-  Robotic Arm Integration
-  Embedded Systems & Arduino Programming
-  Obstacle Detection using Sensors
-  Autonomous Navigation
-  Human-Machine Interface

It integrates mobility and manipulation in one unit — making it ideal for use in **industries, disaster zones, farms**, and **hazardous areas**.
